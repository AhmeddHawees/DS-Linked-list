# DS-Linked-list
The project aims to develop a mini text editor using a linked list data structure. The text editor will provide basic functionality to create, edit, and manipulate text documents. Instead of using a traditional array-based approach for storing text, a linked list will be utilized to efficiently manage the text content.
